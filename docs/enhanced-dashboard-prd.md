# Enhanced dashboard PRD for modul8r

## Product overview

### Vision statement

Transform modul8r from a basic PDF-to-Markdown converter into a professional-grade document processing platform with comprehensive situational awareness, enabling users to monitor, control, and optimize their conversion workflows in real-time.

### Product goals

- **Primary**: Provide complete visibility into PDF conversion processes through real-time analytics and progress monitoring.
- **Secondary**: Enable dynamic optimization and control of processing parameters during execution.
- **Tertiary**: Deliver enterprise-grade user experience while maintaining system performance and reliability.

### Target users

- **Primary**: Personal users processing large or complex RPG documents on 64GB laptops requiring progress visibility.
- **Secondary**: Single users needing basic performance insights and job control.
- **Out of scope**: Enterprise users and multi-user batch processing (deferred to future iterations).


### System context

- **Target environment**: Single-user laptop with 64GB RAM.
- **Performance focus**: Stability and correctness over memory optimization.
- **Concurrency**: Single user, WebSocket throughput <10 msg/s.
- **Resource constraints**: Memory budget serves as leak guard, not optimization goal.
- **Existing foundation**: FastAPI backend, WebSocket log streaming, structured logging, basic web UI already implemented.


## Problem statement


### Current user pain points

modul8r currently provides minimal visibility into the PDF conversion process, leaving users uncertain about:

- **Progress transparency**: No indication of completion percentage or time remaining during conversion.
- **Real-time feedback**: Front-end only shows "Converting..." until HTTP response returns.
- **Performance awareness**: No insights into processing speed or bottlenecks.
- **Error understanding**: Limited context for failures or quality issues during processing.

**Note**: Advanced controls like pause/resume and resource monitoring are deferred based on feasibility assessment showing they exceed single-user value proposition.


### Market context

- Personal-use application with potential for enterprise expansion.
- Competition includes basic PDF converters without real-time monitoring.
- Opportunity to differentiate through comprehensive process visibility.


## Solution approach


### Core solution: Enhanced dashboard with real-time analytics

Implement a comprehensive dashboard that transforms the current basic interface into a professional monitoring and control center while maintaining the robust async architecture and performance characteristics of the existing system.


### Key differentiators

- **Real-time WebSocket-based progress monitoring** with existing log infrastructure
- **Simple progress visualization** using proven patterns
- **Performance-optimized implementation** building on existing async architecture
- **Built-in safeguards** preventing message overflow and memory leaks


## Feature specifications


### Phase 1: Foundation safeguards (week 1) - critical prerequisite


#### 1.1 Message throttling system

**Priority**: P0 (Blocking for all other features)

**Requirements**:

- Batch WebSocket messages to prevent connection overflow.
- Limit message rate to <10 messages/second average.
- Implement circuit breaker for high-volume scenarios.

**Technical specification**:

```python
class ThrottledBroadcaster:
    def __init__(self, batch_interval=0.5, max_batch_size=100):  # Increased for 64GB environment
        self.batch_interval = batch_interval
        self.max_batch_size = max_batch_size
        self.pending_messages = []
        self.flush_task = None

    async def queue_message(self, message):
        self.pending_messages.append(message)

        # Start timer-based flush if not already running
        if self.flush_task is None:
            self.flush_task = asyncio.create_task(self._timer_flush())

        # Immediate flush if batch is full
        if len(self.pending_messages) >= self.max_batch_size:
            await self.flush_batch()

    async def _timer_flush(self):
        """Ensure messages are flushed even during low activity periods"""
        await asyncio.sleep(self.batch_interval)
        await self.flush_batch()

    async def flush_batch(self):
        if self.pending_messages:
            # Cancel timer task since we're flushing now
            if self.flush_task and not self.flush_task.done():
                self.flush_task.cancel()
            self.flush_task = None

            batched = {
                "type": "batch_update",
                "messages": self.pending_messages.copy(),
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            }
            await self.broadcast(batched)
            self.pending_messages.clear()
```

**Acceptance criteria**:

  - [ ] WebSocket message rate remains under 10 msg/sec during peak load.
  - [ ] No connection buffer overflows during 100-page PDF processing.
  - [ ] Batching reduces message volume by 60-80% without UX degradation.

#### 1.2 Memory management system

**Priority**: P0 (Prevent system instability)

**Requirements**:

  - Extend existing `LogCapture.max_entries` with age-based eviction.
  - Prevent memory leaks from WebSocket connections.
  - Monitor and limit memory growth per session.

**Technical specification** (building on existing `LogCapture`):

```python
# Extend existing LogCapture class rather than creating new system
class EnhancedLogCapture(LogCapture):
    def __init__(self, max_entries=1000, max_age_seconds=3600):
        super().__init__(max_entries=max_entries)
        self.max_age_seconds = max_age_seconds
        self.cleanup_task = asyncio.create_task(self.periodic_cleanup())

    async def periodic_cleanup(self):
        """Add age-based cleanup to existing size-based management"""
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(300)  # Every 5 minutes
            cutoff = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(seconds=self.max_age_seconds)
            
            # Reuse existing entries deque from parent class
            while self.entries and self.entries[0].get('timestamp', datetime.min) < cutoff:
                self.entries.popleft()
```

**Acceptance criteria**:

  - [ ] Memory usage per session remains under 150MB.
  - [ ] Zero memory leaks detected in 48-hour stress testing.
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup prevents unlimited log growth.

#### 1.3 Performance monitoring system

**Priority**: P0 (Early warning system)

**Requirements**:

  - Monitor event loop lag with single periodic task.
  - Implement automatic degradation under load.
  - Integrate with existing structured logging.

**Technical specification** (lightweight approach):

```python
class SimpleEventLoopMonitor:
    def __init__(self, max_lag_ms=40):
        self.max_lag_ms = max_lag_ms
        self.last_check = time.perf_counter()
        # Single background task instead of instrumenting all awaits
        self.monitor_task = asyncio.create_task(self.periodic_check())

    async def periodic_check(self):
        """Lightweight periodic event loop lag detection"""
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1.0)  # Check every second
            current = time.perf_counter()
            lag_ms = (current - self.last_check) * 1000
            self.last_check = current

            if lag_ms > self.max_lag_ms:
                # Use existing structured logger
                logger.warning("Event loop lag detected", extra={"lag_ms": lag_ms})
                # Simple degradation: reduce WebSocket message frequency
                await self.trigger_degradation()

    async def trigger_degradation(self):
        """Simple load reduction strategy"""
        # Increase batching interval when under load
        # Reduce non-essential WebSocket messages
        pass
```

**Acceptance criteria**:

  - [ ] Event loop lag detection with \<20ms threshold.
  - [ ] Automatic feature degradation prevents system overload.
  - [ ] Performance metrics logged for analysis.

### Phase 2: Minimal dashboard (week 2)

#### 2.1 Basic progress visualization

**Priority**: P1 (Core user value)

**Requirements**:

  - Single unified progress bar showing 0-100% completion.
  - Essential status messages in plain language.
  - Time elapsed and ETA calculations.
  - Simple error notifications.

**User stories**:

  - As a user, I want to see how much of my PDF conversion is complete.
  - As a user, I want to know how much time is remaining.
  - As a user, I want clear notification of any errors.

**Technical specification** (integrating with existing UI):

```html
<!-- Extend existing conversion form with progress section -->
<div class="conversion-status" style="display: none" id="conversion-progress">
    <div class="primary-progress">
        <progress value="0" max="100" id="progress-bar">0%</progress>
        <div class="status-text" id="status-text">Starting conversion...</div>
        <div class="eta-text" id="eta-text"></div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Use existing collapsible pattern for details -->
    <details class="conversion-details">
        <summary>Processing Details</summary>
        <div class="detail-metrics">
            <span class="metric">Pages/min: <span id="speed-metric">--</span></span>
            <span class="metric">Current: <span id="current-page">--</span></span>
        </div>
    </details>
</div>
```

**Acceptance criteria**:

  - [ ] Progress bar updates smoothly without jank.
  - [ ] ETA accuracy within 20% of actual completion time.
  - [ ] Status messages use plain English, not technical jargon.
  - [ ] Mobile-responsive design maintains usability.

#### 2.2 Enhanced WebSocket message structure

**Priority**: P1 (Infrastructure for dashboard)

**Requirements**:

  - Define structured message types for progress updates.
  - Include job correlation IDs for multi-session support.
  - Implement version control for message compatibility.

**Technical specification**:

**Technical specification** (simple progress messages):

```python
# Lightweight progress schema - extend existing log message structure
class ProgressMessage:
    """Simple progress message structure for WebSocket updates"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_progress_update(current_page: int, total_pages: int, eta_seconds: int = None):
        """Create standardized progress message"""
        progress_pct = (current_page / total_pages) * 100 if total_pages > 0 else 0
        
        return {
            "type": "progress_update",
            "current_page": current_page,
            "total_pages": total_pages,
            "progress_percentage": round(progress_pct, 1),
            "eta_seconds": eta_seconds,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_status_update(status: str, message: str):
        """Create status change message"""
        return {
            "type": "status_update", 
            "status": status,
            "message": message,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }

# Integrate with existing WebSocketManager
# Add progress broadcasting method to existing WebSocketManager class
async def broadcast_progress(websocket_manager, current: int, total: int, eta: int = None):
    """Send progress update through existing WebSocket infrastructure"""
    message = ProgressMessage.create_progress_update(current, total, eta)
    await websocket_manager.broadcast(message)

# Usage in OpenAIService._process_single_image:
# await broadcast_progress(websocket_manager, page_num, total_pages)
```

**Acceptance criteria**:

  - [ ] All messages include proper job correlation.
  - [ ] Message schema validation prevents malformed data.
  - [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing log streaming.

### Phases 3-4: Deferred features

**Status**: Deferred based on feasibility assessment

**Rationale**: The feasibility assessment identified that advanced features like interactive job controls, comprehensive analytics, and enterprise-grade visualizations exceed the value proposition for single-user personal use. These features would:

- Add significant complexity with marginal benefit for personal workflows
- Require substantial maintenance overhead
- Introduce risks around pause/resume in blocking operations (pdf2image, OpenAI calls)
- Create SQLite persistence complexity that may not be needed

**Potential future consideration**: These features may be reconsidered if:
- Real-world usage patterns demonstrate concrete need
- Multi-user or enterprise use cases emerge
- Current Phase 1-2 implementation proves insufficient for user needs

**Alternative approach**: Focus on perfecting Phases 1-2 to provide maximum value with minimal complexity.

## Technical implementation

### Backend architecture changes

#### Minimal state management (in-memory)

```python
# Simple in-memory state tracking - no persistence needed initially
class SimpleProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_jobs = {}  # job_id -> progress_info
        
    def start_job(self, job_id: str, total_pages: int):
        """Initialize job tracking"""
        self.current_jobs[job_id] = {
            'total_pages': total_pages,
            'completed_pages': 0,
            'start_time': datetime.utcnow(),
            'status': 'processing'
        }
    
    def update_progress(self, job_id: str, completed_pages: int):
        """Update job progress"""
        if job_id in self.current_jobs:
            job_info = self.current_jobs[job_id]
            job_info['completed_pages'] = completed_pages
            job_info['last_update'] = datetime.utcnow()
            
            # Simple ETA calculation
            if completed_pages > 0:
                elapsed = (datetime.utcnow() - job_info['start_time']).total_seconds()
                rate = completed_pages / elapsed
                remaining = job_info['total_pages'] - completed_pages
                job_info['eta_seconds'] = int(remaining / rate) if rate > 0 else None
    
    def complete_job(self, job_id: str):
        """Mark job as completed and clean up"""
        self.current_jobs.pop(job_id, None)
```

#### WebSocket connection resilience

```javascript
// Extend existing WebSocket connection logic with progress handling
class ProgressWebSocketClient {
    constructor(existingWebSocket) {
        this.ws = existingWebSocket;
        this.progressCallback = null;
        this.statusCallback = null;
        
        // Extend existing message handler
        this.ws.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            
            if (data.type === 'progress_update' && this.progressCallback) {
                this.progressCallback(data);
            } else if (data.type === 'status_update' && this.statusCallback) {
                this.statusCallback(data);
            }
            // Let existing log handlers process other message types
        });
    }
    
    setProgressHandler(callback) {
        this.progressCallback = callback;
    }
    
    setStatusHandler(callback) {
        this.statusCallback = callback;
    }
}

// Usage: integrate with existing WebSocket setup
// const progressClient = new ProgressWebSocketClient(existingWebSocket);
// progressClient.setProgressHandler(updateProgressBar);
```

### Frontend architecture

#### Simple DOM updates (no framework needed)

```javascript
// Simple, direct DOM updates for progress - no complex rendering system needed
class SimpleProgressUpdater {
    constructor() {
        this.progressBar = document.getElementById('progress-bar');
        this.statusText = document.getElementById('status-text');
        this.etaText = document.getElementById('eta-text');
        this.speedMetric = document.getElementById('speed-metric');
        this.currentPage = document.getElementById('current-page');
        
        // Throttle rapid updates
        this.lastUpdate = 0;
        this.updateThrottle = 250; // ms
    }
    
    updateProgress(data) {
        const now = Date.now();
        if (now - this.lastUpdate < this.updateThrottle) return;
        this.lastUpdate = now;
        
        // Direct DOM updates - simple and fast
        if (this.progressBar) {
            this.progressBar.value = data.progress_percentage;
        }
        if (this.statusText) {
            this.statusText.textContent = `Processing page ${data.current_page} of ${data.total_pages}`;
        }
        if (this.etaText && data.eta_seconds) {
            this.etaText.textContent = `ETA: ${this.formatTime(data.eta_seconds)}`;
        }
        if (this.currentPage) {
            this.currentPage.textContent = `${data.current_page}/${data.total_pages}`;
        }
    }
    
    formatTime(seconds) {
        const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
        const secs = seconds % 60;
        return `${mins}m ${secs}s`;
    }
}
```

#### Progressive disclosure pattern

  - **Tier 1**: Essential information always visible (progress, status, ETA).
  - **Tier 2**: Contextual details expandable on demand (performance metrics).
  - **Tier 3**: Expert-level information behind preference settings.

### Mobile responsiveness

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .dashboard-grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        grid-gap: 8px;
    }

    .metric-cards {
        display: none; /* Hide on mobile */
    }

    .essential-progress {
        font-size: 1.2em;
        padding: 16px;
    }
}
```

## Risk management

### Critical risk areas (updated based on assessment)

#### 1\. WebSocket message throttling (risk level: medium)

**Risk**: Progress updates could increase message volume, but limited scope reduces this concern.

**Impact**: Potential connection buffer issues during large PDF processing.

**Mitigation**:

  - Implement simple message batching (Phase 1).
  - Use existing WebSocket infrastructure patterns.
  - Test with realistic 200-page conversion scenarios.

#### 2\. Implementation complexity creep (risk level: high)

**Risk**: Attempting to implement enterprise features not suited for single-user workflow.

**Impact**: Development time expansion, maintenance burden, over-engineering.

**Mitigation**:

  - **IMPLEMENTED**: Strict scope limitation to Phases 1-2 only.
  - Focus on extending existing systems rather than creating new ones.
  - Time-boxed development (Phase 1: 1.5 weeks, Phase 2: 1.5 weeks).

#### 3\. Event loop performance (risk level: low)

**Risk**: Additional background tasks could impact processing performance.

**Impact**: Slower PDF conversion, reduced user experience.

**Mitigation**:

  - Use single periodic task for event loop monitoring.
  - Minimal DOM update frequency (250ms throttling).
  - Leverage existing async patterns.

#### 4\. User experience regression (risk level: low)

**Risk**: Added UI elements could confuse or slow down current workflow.

**Impact**: Reduced user satisfaction, task completion issues.

**Mitigation**:

  - Progressive disclosure: details collapsed by default.
  - Maintain existing UI patterns and styling.
  - Simple progress bar that doesn't interfere with current workflow.

### Go/no-go decision criteria

#### Success criteria for implementation

**Phase 1 completion criteria**:

  - [ ] WebSocket message throttling maintains <10 msg/sec average.
  - [ ] Extended LogCapture prevents memory growth during long sessions.
  - [ ] Event loop monitoring detects and logs performance issues.
  - [ ] No performance regression in PDF conversion speed.

**Phase 2 completion criteria**:

  - [ ] Progress bar updates smoothly during conversion.
  - [ ] Status messages provide clear feedback to user.
  - [ ] Mobile interface remains usable and responsive.
  - [ ] No increase in user task completion time.
  - [ ] Implementation stays within 3-week timeline.

#### Rollback triggers (immediate implementation halt)

  - [ ] PDF conversion performance degrades >20% from baseline.
  - [ ] WebSocket connections become unstable or drop frequently.
  - [ ] Browser becomes unresponsive during progress updates.
  - [ ] Memory usage grows unbounded during typical workflows.
  - [ ] Implementation timeline exceeds 4 weeks total.

## Testing strategy (updated for 64gb environment)

### Testing strategy (simplified for Phase 1-2)

```python
# Focus on realistic single-user testing scenarios
def test_progress_message_throttling():
    """Verify message batching works during typical conversion"""
    # Simulate 100-page PDF conversion
    messages_sent = simulate_progress_updates(pages=100)
    assert len(messages_sent) < 50  # Batching reduces message count
    assert max_message_rate < 10    # msg/sec

def test_memory_stability():
    """Ensure no memory leaks during normal operation"""
    initial_memory = get_process_memory()
    # Run 3 consecutive PDF conversions
    for i in range(3):
        simulate_pdf_conversion(pages=50)
    final_memory = get_process_memory()
    assert (final_memory - initial_memory) < 10  # MB growth acceptable

def test_ui_responsiveness():
    """Verify progress updates don't block UI"""
    # Measure DOM update performance
    update_times = measure_progress_updates(count=100)
    assert max(update_times) < 16  # ms (60 FPS equivalent)
    assert average(update_times) < 4  # ms typical

# Integration test with existing test suite
def test_conversion_with_progress_tracking():
    """Ensure progress tracking doesn't break existing functionality"""
    # Use existing test PDF
    result = convert_pdf_with_progress(test_pdf_path)
    assert result.success
    assert result.progress_updates_received > 0
    assert result.final_markdown == expected_output
```

### Key test scenarios for single-user workflow

  - **Typical conversion flow**: 50-page RPG module conversion with progress tracking.
  - **Large document handling**: 200-page conversion without performance degradation.
  - **WebSocket stability**: Connection remains stable during full conversion cycle.
  - **Mobile compatibility**: Progress bar and status visible on tablet screens.
  - **Background task impact**: PDF conversion speed unchanged with progress monitoring active.

### User experience testing

  - **Task completion time**: Compare baseline vs. enhanced dashboard.
  - **Error rate monitoring**: Track user mistakes and confusion (target \<5% increase).
  - **Mobile compatibility**: Test on iOS, Android, and various screen sizes.
  - **Cognitive load assessment**: Measure information processing time.

### Security and privacy testing

  - **Data sanitization**: Verify sensitive information is properly obfuscated.
  - **WebSocket security**: Test message interception prevention.
  - **Browser devtools**: Ensure no sensitive data exposed in debugging.

## Dependencies and infrastructure

### New dependencies

**Phase 1-2**: No new dependencies required
- Use existing FastAPI, asyncio, and WebSocket infrastructure
- Leverage current structured logging system
- Build on existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI

```toml
# No additional dependencies needed for Phase 1-2 implementation
# All functionality builds on existing codebase:
# - FastAPI for WebSocket management 
# - asyncio for background tasks
# - datetime for timestamp handling
# - existing LogCapture for memory management
```

### System requirements

  - **Development**: Same as existing modul8r requirements (64GB laptop environment).
  - **Runtime**: No additional requirements - uses existing FastAPI server.
  - **Browser support**: Same as current implementation (modern browsers with WebSocket support).

### Infrastructure changes

  - **State management**: Simple in-memory tracking (no database needed initially).
  - **Monitoring**: Extends existing structured logging system.
  - **Feature flags**: Not needed for Phase 1-2 (simple implementation).
  - **Persistence**: Deferred - in-memory state sufficient for single-user workflow.

### State persistence (deferred)

**Current approach**: In-memory state tracking only

**Rationale**: The feasibility assessment identified that:
- Single-user workflow doesn't require state recovery across restarts
- SQLite persistence adds complexity and potential event-loop lag
- Most PDF conversions complete within minutes, making restart recovery less critical

**Future consideration**: If real-world usage shows need for job recovery (e.g., very long conversions, frequent server restarts), persistence can be added in a future iteration.

```python
# Current approach: Simple session-based state tracking
# No database dependencies, no I/O overhead, no recovery complexity
# Sufficient for Phase 1-2 implementation
```

## Success metrics

### Technical KPIs (simplified for Phase 1-2)

  - **WebSocket performance**: Message rate within 10 msg/sec during active conversion.
  - **Memory stability**: No unbounded growth during typical 50-200 page conversions.
  - **Performance maintenance**: PDF conversion speed unchanged (±5% acceptable).
  - **Connection reliability**: WebSocket remains stable throughout conversion process.
  - **Implementation efficiency**: Complete within 3-week timeline.

### User experience kpis

  - **Task completion**: Time variance \< 10% from baseline.
  - **User satisfaction**: Score \> 8/10 in post-implementation survey.
  - **Error rate**: Increase \< 5% from current baseline.
  - **Mobile usability**: Score \> 80% in mobile testing (iPad/Android tablets).
  - **Sleep/wake recovery**: 100% state recovery success rate.

### User experience KPIs

  - **Implementation efficiency**: Complete within 3-week timeline (significantly reduced from original 11-week estimate).
  - **Maintenance simplicity**: Minimal ongoing maintenance due to building on existing systems.
  - **Feature utility**: Progress visibility provides clear value for long-running conversions.
  - **Stability focus**: Zero increase in conversion failures or performance issues.

## Migration and rollback strategy

### Feature flag implementation

```python
class FeatureFlags:
    ENHANCED_DASHBOARD = "enhanced_dashboard"
    REAL_TIME_METRICS = "real_time_metrics"

    @staticmethod
    def is_enabled(flag: str, user_id: str = None) -> bool:
        return config.get_feature_flag(flag, user_id)
```

### Rollback plan

  - **Immediate rollback**: Feature flag disable within 30 seconds.
  - **Partial rollback**: Disable specific dashboard components while maintaining core functionality.
  - **Data preservation**: Maintain existing log streaming during rollback.
  - **User communication**: Clear messaging about feature changes.

### A/B testing strategy

  - **Phase 1**: Internal testing only.
  - **Phase 2**: 10% user rollout with performance monitoring.
  - **Phase 3**: 50% user rollout if Phase 2 metrics met.
  - **Phase 4**: 100% rollout or rollback based on user feedback.

## Timeline and milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation safeguards (1-2 weeks)

  - **Week 1**: Message throttling implementation using existing WebSocket infrastructure.
  - **Week 1**: Extend existing LogCapture with age-based cleanup.
  - **Week 1**: Add simple event loop monitoring task.
  - **Buffer**: 0.5 week for integration testing.

### Phase 2: Minimal dashboard (1-2 weeks)

  - **Week 1**: Add progress messages to existing OpenAIService processing loop.
  - **Week 1**: Extend existing HTML UI with progress bar and status display.
  - **Week 1**: Implement simple JavaScript progress handlers.
  - **Buffer**: 0.5 week for mobile testing and UX refinement.

**Total estimated timeline**: 2-4 weeks (significantly reduced by leveraging existing architecture)

### Revised timeline based on feasibility assessment

| Phase | Core Work | Buffer | Total | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 · Foundation Safeguards | 1 | 0.5 | 1.5 | Extend existing systems |
| 2 · Minimal Dashboard | 1 | 0.5 | 1.5 | Build on current UI |
| **Total** | **2** | **1** | **3** | Focus on MVP value |

**Key timeline reductions**:
- Leverage existing WebSocket infrastructure (no new connection system)
- Extend current LogCapture class (no new memory management system) 
- Build on existing UI patterns (no complex framework integration)
- Focus on single lightweight progress schema (no complex message types)
- Use in-memory state only (no SQLite persistence complexity)

## Appendix: Detailed risk assessment

### Updated risk analysis based on feasibility assessment

**WebSocket message volume**:
```
Current baseline: ~12 log messages per page × 100 pages = 1,200 messages
Phase 1-2 dashboard: ~1-2 progress messages per page × 100 pages = 100-200 additional messages
Total increase: ~17% message volume (much lower than original 300-500% estimate)
Single user focus: No multi-user scaling concerns
```

**Memory consumption**:
```
Baseline per session: Existing LogCapture with bounded entries
Phase 1-2 overhead: Simple progress state tracking (~1-2MB additional)
Total impact: Minimal increase due to building on existing infrastructure
64GB environment: Generous headroom makes memory optimization unnecessary
```

**Implementation complexity**:
```
Original estimate: 11 weeks for enterprise-grade dashboard
Reduced scope: 3 weeks by leveraging existing codebase
Risk reduction: 73% timeline reduction by avoiding over-engineering
Maintenance: Minimal due to building on proven patterns
```

This PRD provides the complete specification for implementing the Enhanced Dashboard while managing the significant risks through careful staged implementation, comprehensive monitoring, and clear go/no-go criteria at each phase.
